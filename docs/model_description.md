# Mathematical Model Description

This document provides a comprehensive description of the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation used by the Vehicle Router to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem with order assignment optimization.

## Problem Definition

The Vehicle Router solves the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) with **three distinct optimization methodologies**, each designed for different computational requirements and solution quality needs:

### 🔵 **Methodology 1: Standard MILP (Cost-Only Optimization)**
- **Objective**: Pure cost minimization through optimal truck selection and order assignment
- **Algorithm**: Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) using PuLP/CBC solver
- **Route Handling**: Basic sorted postal code sequences (no route optimization)
- **Features**:
  - Fast solving (< 1 second for typical problems)
  - Minimal memory usage (< 50MB)
  - Excellent scalability (handles 100+ orders efficiently)
  - **Configurable Depot Return**: Option to require trucks to return to depot (default: False)
  - **Depot Location**: Customizable starting/ending point for routes
- **Complexity**: O(|I| × |J|) variables, polynomial solving time
- **Best For**: Cost-sensitive scenarios where route distances are secondary

### 🟡 **Methodology 2: Standard MILP + Greedy Route Optimization** ⭐ (Default)
- **Objective**: Minimize costs (MILP) + minimize distances (post-optimization greedy algorithm)
- **Algorithm**: Two-phase hybrid optimization (MILP → Greedy permutation testing)

subject to:
    Σ_{j=1}^m x_{i,j} = 1                    ∀i ∈ I     (Order assignment)
    Σ_{i=1}^n v_i × x_{i,j} ≤ cap_j         ∀j ∈ J     (Capacity limits)

```

**Model Properties:**

- **Constraints**: n + m + n×m (e.g., 5 + 5 + 25 = 35 constraints)
- **Solve Time**: < 1 second for typical instances
- **Memory**: < 50MB

### 🟡 **Methodology 2: MILP + Greedy Mathematical Model**

#### **Phase 1: MILP (Identical to Standard)**
```
minimize: Z₁ = Σ_{j=1}^m c_j × y_j
subject to: [same constraints as Standard MILP]

Output: Optimal truck selection T* and order assignments A*
```

#### **Phase 2: Greedy Route Optimization Algorithm**
```
For each truck j ∈ T*:
    Let O_j = {orders assigned to truck j from Phase 1}
    Let L_j = {postal codes of orders in O_j}
    
    If |O_j| ≤ 1:
        route_j = depot → L_j → (depot if depot_return)
        distance_j = d(depot, L_j) + d(L_j, depot) × depot_return
    Else:
        best_distance = ∞
        best_route = null
        
        For each permutation π ∈ Permutations(L_j):
            route = depot → π → (depot if depot_return)
            distance = Σ_{k=1}^{|route|-1} d(route[k], route[k+1])
            
            If distance < best_distance:
                best_distance = distance
                best_route = route
        
        route_j = best_route
        distance_j = best_distance

Total_Distance = Σ_{j ∈ T*} distance_j
```

#### **Greedy Algorithm Complexity Analysis**
```
Time Complexity per truck with n_j orders:
- Permutations to test: n_j!
- Distance calculations per permutation: n_j + depot_return
- Total operations per truck: O(n_j! × n_j)

Total Greedy Complexity: O(Σ_{j ∈ T*} n_j! × n_j)

Practical Performance Examples:
n_j = 2: 2! × 2 = 4 operations        → < 0.001s
n_j = 3: 3! × 3 = 18 operations       → < 0.001s  
n_j = 4: 4! × 4 = 96 operations       → < 0.01s
n_j = 5: 5! × 5 = 600 operations      → < 0.05s
n_j = 6: 6! × 6 = 4,320 operations    → < 0.2s
n_j = 7: 7! × 7 = 35,280 operations   → < 1s
n_j = 8: 8! × 8 = 322,560 operations  → < 5s (practical limit)
```

#### **Distance Matrix Integration**
```
Distance Matrix: D ∈ ℝ^{|L|×|L|}
where L = {all postal codes} ∪ {depot}

D[k,l] = distance from location k to location l (km)

Route Distance Calculation:
route_distance(r) = Σ_{i=1}^{|r|-1} D[r[i], r[i+1]]

where r = [depot, loc₁, loc₂, ..., loc_n, (depot if depot_return)]
```

### 🟢 **Methodology 3: Enhanced MILP Mathematical Model**

#### **Extended Sets and Parameters**
```
Sets:
I = {1, 2, ..., n}     # Set of orders
J = {1, 2, ..., m}     # Set of trucks  
L = {1, 2, ..., k}     # Set of locations (postal codes + depot)

Parameters:
v_i ∈ ℝ⁺              # Volume of order i (m³)
c_j ∈ ℝ⁺              # Cost of truck j (€)
cap_j ∈ ℝ⁺            # Capacity of truck j (m³)
d_{k,l} ∈ ℝ⁺          # Distance from location k to l (km)
loc_i ∈ L             # Location of order i
depot ∈ L             # Depot location
α, β ∈ [0,1]          # Objective weights (α + β = 1)
depot_return ∈ {0,1}  # Whether trucks must return to depot
```

#### **Decision Variables**
```
x_{i,j} ∈ {0,1}  ∀i ∈ I, ∀j ∈ J
# Order assignment: x_{i,j} = 1 if order i assigned to truck j

y_j ∈ {0,1}  ∀j ∈ J  
# Truck usage: y_j = 1 if truck j is used

z_{k,l,j} ∈ {0,1}  ∀k,l ∈ L, k≠l, ∀j ∈ J
# Route segments: z_{k,l,j} = 1 if truck j travels from k to l
```

#### **Multi-Objective Function**
```
minimize: Z₃ = α × (Σ_{j=1}^m c_j × y_j) + β × (Σ_{j=1}^m Σ_{k∈L} Σ_{l∈L,l≠k} d_{k,l} × z_{k,l,j})

where:
- First term: Total truck costs (scaled by weight α)
- Second term: Total travel distances (scaled by weight β)
- Typical values: α = 0.6, β = 0.4
```

#### **Complete Enhanced Mathematical Model**
```
minimize: Z₃ = α × Σ_{j=1}^m c_j × y_j + β × Σ_{j=1}^m Σ_{k∈L} Σ_{l∈L,l≠k} d_{k,l} × z_{k,l,j}

subject to:

# Standard constraints from Methodology 1
(1) Σ_{j=1}^m x_{i,j} = 1                    ∀i ∈ I
(2) Σ_{i=1}^n v_i × x_{i,j} ≤ cap_j         ∀j ∈ J
(3) y_j ≥ x_{i,j}                           ∀i ∈ I, ∀j ∈ J
(4) x_{i,j} ∈ {0,1}                         ∀i ∈ I, ∀j ∈ J
(5) y_j ∈ {0,1}                             ∀j ∈ J

# Enhanced routing constraints
(6) Σ_{k∈L,k≠l} z_{k,l,j} = Σ_{k∈L,k≠l} z_{l,k,j} = Σ_{i: loc_i=l} x_{i,j}  ∀l ∈ L\{depot}, ∀j ∈ J
    [Flow conservation: inflow = outflow = orders served at location l]

(7) Σ_{l∈L,l≠depot} z_{depot,l,j} = y_j  ∀j ∈ J
    [Depot outflow: used trucks leave depot exactly once]

(8) Σ_{l∈L,l≠depot} z_{l,depot,j} = y_j × depot_return  ∀j ∈ J
    [Depot inflow: used trucks return to depot if required]

(9) z_{k,l,j} ∈ {0,1}  ∀k,l ∈ L, k≠l, ∀j ∈ J
    [Binary route variables]
```

#### **Enhanced Model Properties**
- **Variables**: n×m + m + m×k×(k-1) ≈ m×k² for large k
- **Constraints**: n + m + n×m + m×(k-1) + 2×m ≈ n×m + m×k
- **Example**: 5 orders, 5 trucks, 6 locations → 210 variables, 95 constraints
- **Solve Time**: 1-30 seconds depending on complexity
- **Memory**: 100-500MB for medium instances

#### **Flow Conservation Detailed Explanation**
```
For each location l ≠ depot and truck j:

Inflow to l:  Σ_{k≠l} z_{k,l,j}  (trucks arriving at l)
Outflow from l: Σ_{k≠l} z_{l,k,j}  (trucks leaving l)  
Orders at l:  Σ_{i: loc_i=l} x_{i,j}  (orders served at l by truck j)

Conservation: inflow = outflow = orders served

This ensures:
- Trucks only visit locations with assigned orders
- No subtours or disconnected routes
- Proper route continuity from depot through customers
```

#### **Objective Scaling and Normalization**
```
Raw objectives have different scales:
- Truck costs: €500 - €2000 per truck
- Distances: 1-50 km per route segment

Normalization approach:
cost_scale = Σ_{j} c_j  (maximum possible truck cost)
distance_scale = max_{k,l} d_{k,l} × |L| × |J|  (maximum possible distance)

Normalized objective:
Z₃ = α × (truck_cost / cost_scale) + β × (total_distance / distance_scale)

This ensures both terms contribute meaningfully to the objective.
```

## Mathematical Formulation

### Sets and Indices

| Symbol | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `I` | Set of orders (indexed by `i`) |
| `J` | Set of trucks (indexed by `j`) |
| `K` | Set of locations/postal codes (indexed by `k`) |

### Parameters

| Symbol | Description | Units |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| `v_i` | Volume of order `i` | m³ |
| `c_j` | Operational cost of truck `j` | € |
| `cap_j` | Capacity of truck `j` | m³ |
| `d_{k,l}` | Distance between locations `k` and `l` | km |
| `loc_i` | Location (postal code) of order `i` | - |

### Decision Variables

#### Standard Model
The standard MILP formulation uses two types of binary decision variables:

**Order Assignment Variables:**
```
x_{i,j} ∈ {0, 1}  ∀i ∈ I, ∀j ∈ J
```
- `x_{i,j} = 1` if order `i` is assigned to truck `j`
- `x_{i,j} = 0` otherwise

**Truck Usage Variables:**
```
y_j ∈ {0, 1}  ∀j ∈ J
```
- `y_j = 1` if truck `j` is used in the solution
- `y_j = 0` otherwise

#### Enhanced Model
The enhanced MILP formulation includes additional routing variables:

**Routing Variables:**
```
z_{j,k,l} ∈ {0, 1}  ∀j ∈ J, ∀k,l ∈ K, k ≠ l
```
- `z_{j,k,l} = 1` if truck `j` travels directly from location `k` to location `l`
- `z_{j,k,l} = 0` otherwise

### Objective Function

#### Standard Model
The standard model minimizes total truck operational costs:

```
minimize: ∑_{j ∈ J} c_j × y_j
```

This formulation focuses on truck selection costs and is suitable when fixed costs dominate.

#### Enhanced Model
The enhanced model minimizes a weighted combination of truck costs and travel distances:

```
minimize: α × (∑_{j ∈ J} c_j × y_j) + β × (∑_{j ∈ J} ∑_{k ∈ K} ∑_{l ∈ K} d_{k,l} × z_{j,k,l})
```

Where:
- `α` = cost weight (typically 0.6)
- `β` = distance weight (typically 0.4)
- `α + β = 1` for proper scaling
- `z_{j,k,l}` = routing variables indicating truck `j` travels from location `k` to `l`

This multi-objective approach balances cost efficiency with route optimization.

### Constraints

#### Standard Model Constraints

**1. Order Assignment Constraints**
Each order must be assigned to exactly one truck:

```
∑_{j ∈ J} x_{i,j} = 1  ∀i ∈ I
```

**Interpretation**: Every order is delivered exactly once.

**2. Capacity Constraints**
The total volume of orders assigned to each truck cannot exceed its capacity:

```
∑_{i ∈ I} v_i × x_{i,j} ≤ cap_j  ∀j ∈ J
```

**Interpretation**: No truck exceeds its capacity limit.

**3. Truck Usage Constraints**
If any order is assigned to a truck, the truck must be marked as used:

```
y_j ≥ x_{i,j}  ∀i ∈ I, ∀j ∈ J
```

**Interpretation**: Truck usage variables are properly linked to order assignments.

#### Enhanced Model Additional Constraints

**4. Route Continuity Constraints**
For each truck and location, flow conservation must be maintained:

```
∑_{l ∈ K, l ≠ k} z_{j,l,k} = ∑_{l ∈ K, l ≠ k} z_{j,k,l} = ∑_{i ∈ I: loc_i = k} x_{i,j}  ∀j ∈ J, ∀k ∈ K
```

**Interpretation**: If a truck visits a location, it must arrive and depart, serving all assigned orders.

**5. Depot Constraints**
Each used truck must start and end at the depot:

```
∑_{k ∈ K, k ≠ depot} z_{j,depot,k} = y_j  ∀j ∈ J
∑_{k ∈ K, k ≠ depot} z_{j,k,depot} = y_j  ∀j ∈ J
```

**Interpretation**: Used trucks leave and return to the depot exactly once.

### Complete MILP Formulation

```
minimize: ∑_{j ∈ J} c_j × y_j

subject to:
    ∑_{j ∈ J} x_{i,j} = 1                    ∀i ∈ I     (Order assignment)
    ∑_{i ∈ I} v_i × x_{i,j} ≤ cap_j         ∀j ∈ J     (Capacity limits)
    y_j ≥ x_{i,j}                           ∀i ∈ I, ∀j ∈ J  (Truck usage)
    x_{i,j} ∈ {0, 1}                        ∀i ∈ I, ∀j ∈ J  (Binary variables)
    y_j ∈ {0, 1}                            ∀j ∈ J     (Binary variables)
```

```
∑_{t ∈ T} u_{j,t} = 1  ∀j ∈ J
```

## Implementation Details

### PuLP Integration
The Vehicle Router uses the PuLP library to implement this MILP formulation:

```python
# Create decision variables
x = {}
for i in orders:
    for j in trucks:
        x[i,j] = pulp.LpVariable(f"assign_{i}_to_{j}", cat='Binary')

y = {}
for j in trucks:
    y[j] = pulp.LpVariable(f"use_truck_{j}", cat='Binary')

# Set objective
model += pulp.lpSum([cost[j] * y[j] for j in trucks])

# Add constraints
for i in orders:
    model += pulp.lpSum([x[i,j] for j in trucks]) == 1

for j in trucks:
    model += pulp.lpSum([volume[i] * x[i,j] for i in orders]) <= capacity[j]
    
for i in orders:
    for j in trucks:
        model += y[j] >= x[i,j]
```

### Solver Configuration
