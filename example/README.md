# Vehicle Router Examples

This folder contains practical examples of how to use the Vehicle Router optimizers.

## Files

- `vehicle_router_examples.ipynb` - Comprehensive Jupyter notebook with examples

## Getting Started

1. **Install Jupyter Notebook** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Open the example notebook**:
   - Navigate to the `example` folder
   - Open `vehicle_router_examples.ipynb`

## What's Included

The notebook demonstrates:

- **Setup and Imports**: How to import and configure the Vehicle Router
- **Basic Example**: Simple optimization with example data
- **Standard MILP + Greedy**: Two-phase hybrid optimization
- **Enhanced MILP**: Multi-objective optimization with weighting
- **Genetic Algorithm**: Evolutionary metaheuristic approach
- **Custom Data**: Using your own orders and trucks
- **Performance Comparison**: Comparing all three methods
- **Visualization**: Creating plots of routes, costs, and utilization

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- All Vehicle Router dependencies (see main `requirements.txt`)

## Running the Examples

1. Make sure you're in the project root directory
2. Start Jupyter Notebook
3. Open `example/vehicle_router_examples.ipynb`
4. Run the cells sequentially

Each cell is designed to be run independently, so you can experiment with different sections.
